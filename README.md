### About Dataset

#### Context
I was looking for an interesting dataset for a personal Data Science project, and I'm a fan of TED. So, I looked for the TED dataset, found Rounka's but it is incomplete and outdated. Then, I scraped myself and made it super fast using Parallel Programming. Now, it downloads all Metadata along with the Transcript in 300 seconds of all 4609 Talks on the website*. This is the most comprehensive TED Talk dataset which includes media files (images, audio, and video) too!

* Scraped on 24-JUN-20. One can scrape entire TED.com using the code to get the latest dataset in 5 minutes.

#### Content
Each row corresponds to a Talk on TED.com and each column details Metadata (generic/speaker/talk related information) plus Transcript.
